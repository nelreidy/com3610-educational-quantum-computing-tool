    "description": "A basic quantum error correction method. Similar to the bit-flip error code, with the introduction of Hadamard gates after encoding, and before decoding. A phase-flip error is where a qubit state is flipped from ∣+⟩ to ∣−⟩ or vice versa. The same logic as the bit-flip code is applied. The Pauli-Z gate between the two barriers simulates a phase flip error - toggle the measurement probe for q[0] to 'on' to observe."
