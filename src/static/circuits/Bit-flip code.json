    "description": "A basic quantum error correction method. A bit-flip error is when a qubit state is flipped from ∣0⟩ to ∣1⟩ or vice versa. The idea of the bit-flip code is to encode the single qubit as an entangled state of 3 qubits. Toggle the measurement to 'on' for q[0], and observe. The Pauli-X gate between the two barriers is simulating a bit flip error on q[0]. The barriers divide the circuit into the sections 'encoding', 'error' and 'decoding'."
