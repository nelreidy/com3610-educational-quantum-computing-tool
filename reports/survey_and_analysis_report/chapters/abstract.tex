\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

Quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography and optimization. However, its complexity and steep learning curve present barriers for newcomers. This project builds on an existing quantum circuit simulator, aiming to provide an accessible, structured learning platform. The proposed system includes a comprehensive lesson plan covering quantum principles, algorithms, and practical applications, supported by integrated quizzes, assignments, and a Qiskit environment for hands-on exploration. \\

To date, a literature survey and analysis of existing educational tools have been completed, and a lesson plan has been drafted. Implementation has begun, focusing on creating interactive modules that guide users from foundational concepts to advanced quantum simulations. Ongoing research continues to inform development, refining the platform to reduce learning barriers and inspire new learners in quantum computing\\

This report details the background, challenges in quantum education, and the design of an interactive, beginner-friendly learning system that bridges theory and application..
